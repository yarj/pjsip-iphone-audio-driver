[Voalte](http://www.voalte.com) is redefining hospital mobile point-of-care communication by providing a complete solution for voice, alarms and text messaging on a robust expandable platform - the Apple iPhone. The resulting improvement in clinician workflow leads to better patient outcomes and improvements in nurse job satisfaction.

Voalte created this audio driver for our iPhone application and has decided to open source it.  We want to encourage open collaboration and active development to make this the best iPhone audio driver for the PJSIP framework.
